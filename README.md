# My Information

Hello Everyone!<br>
I have made a simple Flutter application which could store all my important data in one place but more importantly keeps me motivated to try new things! The main aim to build this app was all the documents, images and other important files I can upload and download quickly through my phone and my To-Do list.  
<br><br>

<h2>Home Page</h2>
This is the home page of my app where I could add more details of mine and I can quickly access my important links like my Github profile, my YouTube channel as well as my portpolio.<br><br>

<br><br>

<h2>Skills Page</h2>
This skills page keeps track of my current knowledge aboout new technologies and motivates me to gain the knowledge where I lack.<br><br>

<br><br>

<h2>My Documents Page</h2>
I have used Firebase database for this app. This is my Firebase console before I upload any file from my device.<br><br>

<h3>Here is how this Page works:</h3>
1. If I feel any file is important, I would open the app and click on Select button.<br>
2. I will select that file and we will see the status of file loaded. Once it is loaded 100%, I will click on Upload button.<br>                                     
3. Now once I refresh the page, I would be able to see that document in the list of documents.<br>
4. Here I uploaded my resume(Rohan Sadawarte.pdf) file first and as soon as I refreshed we can see that file in the list.<br>
5. Then later, I downloaded two files (Machine Learning, Rohan Sadawarte) and we can see both the files in downloads folder of our device with current time (7:16 PM)<br>

Here we can see the Firebase console again with Rohan Sadawarte.pdf file added<br><br>

<h2>To-Do List Page</h2>
This page keeps me use my app daily all the time as I can add all the To-Do's daily and keep the track of my daily activites.<br><br>
