# My Information

Hello Everyone!<br>
I have made a simple Flutter application which could store all my important data in one place but more importantly keeps me motivated to try new things! The main aim to build this app was all the documents, images and other important files I can upload and download quickly through my phone and my To-Do list.  
<br><br>

<h2>Home Page</h2>
This is the home page of my app where I could add more details of mine and I can quickly access my important links like my Github profile, my YouTube channel as well as my portpolio.<br><br>

This skills page keeps track of my current knowledge aboout new technologies and motivates me to gain the knowledge where I lack.<br><br>
